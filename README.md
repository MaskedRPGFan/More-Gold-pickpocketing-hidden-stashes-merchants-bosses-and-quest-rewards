## Installation

Use only one main file: [instruction](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Guide:Installing_Mods).

## Compatibility

* ‚úÖ Compatible with mods that change gold, as long as my mod is after them in the load order.
* ‚úÖ Base game (Patch 7, Hotfix #26).

## Troubleshooting

I tested mod as much as I could and should be no problems, but if something is not working correctly, please use **[Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1400?tab=bugs)** tab and create bug report ‚ò†Ô∏è:

## FAQ

### Installation/Updating/Uninstallation?

Anytime. This mod leaves nothing in the save.

Note that because of the way the game handles objects in the world, if an object is loaded on map before the mod is installed, its properties will be frozen, so the gold will also be frozen. You will need to start a new game or a new act for the gold from enemies to work.
